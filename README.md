KubeAnalyzer is an AI-powered agent that runs within your Kubernetes cluster to continuously analyze and report on critical aspects of your infrastructure. It provides actionable insights on observability coverage, container vulnerabilities, and cluster health.

## Features

üîç **Comprehensive Cluster Analysis**:
- **Observability Coverage**: Identifies services lacking proper monitoring, logging, or tracing
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Detects security vulnerabilities in running containers
- **Cluster Health**: Proactively identifies potential issues and optimization opportunities

ü§ñ **AI-Powered Intelligence**:
- Learns from your cluster's behavior and patterns over time
- Provides context-aware recommendations based on best practices
- Adapts to your specific environment and workloads

üìä **Actionable Reporting**:
- Clear, prioritized findings with remediation suggestions
- Multiple report formats (JSON, YAML, HTML)
- Integration with notification systems

## Quick Start
