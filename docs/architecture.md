# KubeAnalyzer Architecture

## Overview

KubeAnalyzer is designed as an AI-powered agent that runs within your Kubernetes cluster, analyzing various aspects of your infrastructure to provide actionable insights and recommendations. This document outlines the high-level architecture of the system.

## System Components

### Core Components

1. **Kubernetes Client Interface**
   - Interacts with the Kubernetes API server
   - Discovers running services, deployments, and pods
   - Collects configuration and state information

2. **Analyzer Modules**
   - **Observability Analyzer**: Evaluates monitoring coverage across services
   - **Vulnerability Scanner**: Identifies security vulnerabilities in containers
   - **Cluster Health Analyzer**: Detects potential issues in the cluster

3. **AI Engine**
   - Processes collected data using machine learning models
   - Identifies patterns and anomalies
   - Generates recommendations based on best practices and historical data
   - Adapts to specific cluster environments over time

4. **Reporting System**
   - Generates comprehensive reports in multiple formats
   - Prioritizes findings based on severity and impact
   - Provides actionable remediation steps

## Data Flow

1. **Data Collection**
   - KubeAnalyzer polls the Kubernetes API to discover resources
   - Metadata from running containers is collected
   - Metrics and logs are sampled as needed

2. **Analysis Processing**
   - Raw data is processed through specialized analyzers
   - The AI engine enriches findings with context and recommendations
   - Results are aggregated and prioritized

3. **Reporting and Alerting**
   - Findings are formatted into structured reports
   - Critical issues trigger notifications through configured channels
   - Historical data is stored for trend analysis

## Deployment Architecture

KubeAnalyzer is deployed as a Kubernetes application within the target cluster:

- **Pod**: Contains the main application container with minimal privileges
- **ServiceAccount**: Used for authentication with the Kubernetes API
- **RBAC**: Configured with read-only permissions to the necessary resources
- **Service**: Exposes the web UI and API endpoints
- **ConfigMap/Secret**: Stores configuration settings

## Security Considerations

- Runs with principle of least privilege using RBAC
- No write permissions to cluster resources
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Container runs as non-root user
- Network policies restrict communication to necessary endpoints

## Extensibility

KubeAnalyzer is designed to be extensible through:

- Plugin architecture for additional analyzers
- Custom rules for environment-specific checks
- API integrations with external systems
- Configurable reporting and alerting mechanisms
